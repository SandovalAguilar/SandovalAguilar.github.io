## About me

### Hello World!

I am a student with a huge interest in applied mathematics (optimization, statistics, probability, etc.), programming (Python, R, SQL) and data science; basically, anything that allows me to model and have a better understanding about the the events around me.

``` python
print("Modeling the world one line at a time")
```

I’m currently working on getting certified in these areas, as well as building my own portfolio and, eventually, doing internships.
